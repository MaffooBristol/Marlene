The new sensation in BeaverBots.

Usage
-----

Modify data/keys.json with the secrets generated on dev.twitter.com - requires read/write permissions.

Send a single tweet by running

`node init.js`

Add the `--dry-run` or `-d` flag to view the tweet you would have sent, without actually sending it. A bit like seeing the boat you could have won at the end of Bullseye.

A lot more things will be added in the future, mainly DB stuff so the same tweet is not replied to more than once, the triggers and responses are a bit more seemingly random. That kinda thing.
